The main feature of the code is a while loop which runs forever or until the robot is turned off. There are multiple if statements which check certain conditions and sensor readings If a condition is satisfied, then the corresponding block of code in the if statement is executed. Helper methods have been written in order to break larger or repetitive actions into smaller pieces. In order to provide the required delay in executing motor commands, the robot control thread is delayed in execution through the use of Thread.Sleep(). 

The API's used include MonoBrick, which manages actual communication with the robot, and the Windows Forms API in order to provide functionality for listening for keyboard events. The code which utilizes MonoBrick communication had to be run as a seperate thread because a single-threaded approach could not handle listening for sensor readings and keypresses, and would have caused significant delays in execution. The main while loop is executed in this seperate thread, and the original thread is used to listen for events and pass them onto the robot control thread.
